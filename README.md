*better-rolltables* is Module for FoundryVTT to improve and add functionality to Rollable tables
Implementing for example the Treasure Hoard" Tables from the Dungeon master manual becomes possible!

For every BRT Rolltable there is a specific sheet for manage the many use cases, so make sure to check if you see these before open any issues.

## Features

- Weight normalization: Generates appropriate weight value to results based on range, as opposed to doing the inverse with base sheet.
- Drag & drop re-ordering: Allows drag & dropping results to re-order them. This involves above weight normalization being called automatically as ordering is based on ranges, and doing it without weights is unnecessarily difficult, so make sure this is intended.
- Text result rich editor: Allows editing a text result in ProseMirror.
- Enhance your RollTables with Drag and Drop, Generate Loot, Encounters and and build your NPC Generator!
- Roll on multiple tables with roll formulas
- Auto create a loot actor to store generated loot
- (REMOVED) Automatically select a random spells when a scroll item is selected
- A table can specify multiple currencies (with roll formulas) to always be awarded
- Adds an option to change the table roll to GM only.
- Adds the option to automatically import rolled items in controlled actors
- Red colored background for broken references to a document on the specific row of the results table
- Use percentages instead of the mechanism with the range and weight to retrieve objects from a rolltable. Values range from 1 to 100 with a step of 0.1, so values such as 27.1 or 0.5 are accepted.

### Add some contextual action on the compendium directory

## Integration with the module [Better Harvesting and Looting](https://github.com/OhhLoz/Harvester)

In the BRT Harvest Rolltable sheet, the "Source Reference" field is the one used by the  [Better Harvesting and Looting](https://github.com/OhhLoz/Harvester) module to connect the monster to the rolltable ! So **"Source Reference" === "Name of The Monster"** , and REMEMBER YOU MUST PUT THE NEW ROLLTABLE IN THE BRT COMPENDIUM "better-rolltables.brt-harvest-harvester" or in the Rolltable directory of the world itself (for now).

## NOTE: This module is under maintenance, I have no plans to update or add features. However, I will try to fix any bugs as possible. Any contribution is welcome.

## FAQ

**Is there a way to from a rolltable to call another roll table and have it roll 4d4 times?** The use case you told me is very general, but to roll an inner (or child ) rolltable 4d4 times of you just need to set in the quanity field the string "4d4" and an amount roll of at least 1.
