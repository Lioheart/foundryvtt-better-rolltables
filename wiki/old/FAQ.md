### Q) I set the amount of rolls but I still get only 1 result
Every time you change something on a table make sure to press update before rolling to be sure all the changes are applied. Often with input fields if you do not press enter after editing they are not saved yet.

### Q) the currency generation is not working
Check that your numbers do not contain , or . (1000 and not 1,000 or 1.000)

Make sure currency is formatted with this notations: ```(2d6)*100[cp], (2d6)*1000[sp], (6d6)*100[gp], 3d6+3[pp]```

If you are not sure your formula is valid, try to roll it in chat with /r formula, for example /r (2d6)*100, if the formula works in chat it will work with the mod

### Q) Scrolls don't get a random spell rolled
For 5e Make sure you are using the scroll that comes with the dnd5e.items srd compendium. Scroll need to be named:
* Spell Scroll Cantrip Level
* Spell Scroll 1st Level
* Spell Scroll 2nd Level
and so on...
